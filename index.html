    <h3>
        Why are you traveling alone?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The first question any prospective solo-traveler must ask, before taking any other steps, is to ask <em>why?</em>
    This may seem like an absurd first step, and for some, even many, the answer is obvious. Nevertheless, it fundamentally changes the outlook one has in regards to long-distance travel.
    Below are some common reasons:
    </p>
    <ul class="reasons-list">
            <li>Just getting away from it all?</li>
            <li>A personal challenge?</li>
            <li> Self-reflection or time with your thoughts?</li>
            <li>Simply no other choice?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Getting ahead of the headache
    </h3>
    <p>
        With your reasoning in mind, it's time to anticipate the difficulties you could run into on such a journey. Don't start worrying about what to bring with you, where you're going, and more logistical details just yet; instead, plan ahead for the unforeseen. Here's a few examples:

    </p>
    <ul class="reasons-list">
        <li>If going by car; running low on gas, damaged tires, road closures and construction.</li>
        <li>If going by bus; cancellations, tight transfer windows, and outdated timetable information.</li>
        <li>If going by foot; hazardous weather, long stretches without shelter, damage to shoes or other equipment.</li>
    </ul>
